## [Designing Class Diagram](https://github.com/ashishps1/awesome-low-level-design?tab=readme-ov-file)

### 1. **Understand the Purpose of the Application**
   - Determine what you need the diagram to represent. Are you modeling a specific part of a system, or the entire system? Clarify the scope of the design. Analyze user needs and system constraints. Understand expected system interactions and workflows.

### 2. **Identify Key Classes**
   - Identify the main objects or entities that need to be represented in the system. These might include real-world objects or concepts that the software needs to model.
   - Example: In Insurance Application, classes could include `User`, `Policy`, `Application`, `Payment`, `PaymentHistory`, `Claim`, `Notification`, etc.

### 3. **Define Attributes**
   - Identify the properties or attributes that each class should have. These represent the data that each object will hold.
   - Example:
      - User class - `userID`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `phone number`, `address`, `dateOfBirth`.
      - Policy class - `policyID`, `policyName`, `description`, `coverageAmount`, `premiumAmount`, `policyType`, `startDate`, `endDate`.
      - Application class - `applicationID`, `applicationType`, `applicationDate`, `applicationStatus`.
      - Payment class - `paymentID`, `paymentAmount`, `paymentDate`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentStatus`.
      - PaymentHistory class - `paymentHistoryID`, `paymentDate`, `paymentAmount`, `paymentMethod`.
      - Claim class -  `claimID`, `claimDate`, `claimAmount`, `claimStatus`, `claimDetails`.
      - Notificatin class - `notificationID`, `notificationType`, `message`, `dateSent`.

### 4. **Define Methods**
   - Determine the behavior of each class by identifying the methods or functions each class will have. These operations define the actions that can be performed on instances of the class.
   - Example:
      - User class - `register()`, `logIn()`, `updateProfile()`, `receiveNotification()`.
      - Policy class - `viewDetails()`, `applyForPolicy()`, `renewPolicy()`, `cancelPolicy()`.
      - Application class - `submitApplication()`, `trackApplicationStatus()`.
      - Payment class - `makePayment()`, `viewPaymentHistory()`.
      - Claim class - `submitClaim()`, `trackClaimStatus()`, `viewClaimHistory()`.

### 5. **Define Relationships Between Classes**
   - Identify how the classes interact with each other. This includes:
     - **Associations**: Classes are related to one another in some way.
     - **Generalization**: One class inherits properties and behaviors from another.
     - **Specialization**: is a form of generalization, which means that a subclass is a more specific version of the superclass.
     - **Realization**: one class implements the behavior of the other class or interface.
     - **Aggregation/Composition**: One class is made up of other classes.
     - **Dependency**: One class depends on another for its functionality.
  
   - Example:
      - A User can have many Policies, Applications, Payments and Claims.
      - Policies generate Applications, require Payments, and cover Claims.
      - Payments relate to both Users and Policies.
      - Claim is related to both User and Policy.
      - Notifications are sent to Users. 
   
### 6. **Draw the Class Diagram**
   - Now, start creating the actual diagram using UML (Unified Modeling Language) notation:
     - **Class boxes**: Represent each class with a rectangle divided into three sections (name, attributes, and methods).
     - **Lines for relationships**: Draw lines to represent associations, inheritance, and other relationships.
     - **Arrows for directionality**: Use arrows to indicate the direction of associations or dependencies.
     - **Multiplicity**: Indicate the number of instances related (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) next to association lines.
   - [Example](https://uml.planttext.com/plantuml/png/XLNBRjim4BmRy3yGFlM11CrLXo9kZ28vr0sGzWDeQMqJuKCXAHj2qNylkQGiKgRIcpWSxSxiaijxOwcsdU3BnN9HSseC-Mr0ap_B1I6VE_VvjAa8anRNaWgeYB6QoGC282ZZ6TAw46UbcnmyAWdRJkn0PpXj6Wt6P5X3BVpSVsFQ7YlY5uXgE31ZGN_uY4kk3ayoVdUjPprhjMSS8gQX1dQ2hR9ipsfgcKBstz7bi-AixgFF5XUfqu1iftuRCBLchO-NuRKwWQO7M0lLILkHFLSq1j8WM2SA6vZXLz_c6R0V6sSeCG-ocI0d1kSDM5Ty4ntJjkNzTwM3hqiP99mpfAQo1Zv2IKNMBaAiLImB7P6qDWby9J_PcqXETbuijLtUTTFj1BE9XAZNQbg_hgU_Jdj9Um7I3iqCgwoR0Ieq8MnCf4Rq1zYZcXpai5Cm8EWhH1rHkkzHH1xTsLLwMl1yCrSVmOA9ijPPQrCJIVu7Jfc8QMl_dMP3O98BiUjC21TA4aA4KrfeDgPFs_mmnabAY6YvWEdrZZva0cMJAy6l3grmCyXTtginz0BUQB2FQN4qhkvMvERcArbzkRtzj1e6IKMEr9GPwSLoET3y37KuoHNnvsc65FhsdqXPRIeI1wBnBgBYTrKUtEJGphYPeuzADRnrJCyp1xau8r50ckf2lajAkLTwdeLk1_SM6hBhqLKKLA0AsW2oIfmywOKptCgCcdZclZZ4AlzBS5WC6eWD4gzfKPz_k0ORMTzAjhs0aFRUlGluSly3)

### 7. **Refine the Design**
   - To refine the class diagram, we need to ensure that it accurately reflects the real-world entities, attributes, their relationships, and their responsibilities in a manner that adheres to principles such as:
      - **[OOP](https://github.com/kvinay7/interview-preparation/blob/main/Java.md#object-oriented-programming-oop)**: helps to create efficient, modular, and maintainable code.
      - **Encapsulation**: Protects data and ensures controlled access.
      - **Abstraction**: Simplifies the system by hiding unnecessary details.
      - **Composition Over Inheritance**: Increases flexibility and modularity.
      - **Cohesion (Single Responsibility)**: Ensures that classes are focused and have a clear purpose.
      - **Open/Closed**: Enables easy extension without modifying existing code.
      - **Liskov Substitution Principle**: ensures that subclasses are extensions of their parent classes.
      - **Interface Segregation**: Promotes specialized interfaces, improving usability.
      - **Dependency Inversion**: Makes systems more flexible and maintainable.
      - **Normalization (DRY Principle)**: Ensures data consistency and reduces redundancy.
      - **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Separates business logic from UI and user input.

## [Implementation](https://github.com/kvinay7/Insurance/blob/main/InsuranceApplication.java)
## [Spring Framework](https://github.com/kvinay7/interview-preparation/blob/main/Spring.md)

## Design Patterns:

### 1. **Eager Initialization** (Thread-safe but not lazy-loaded)
This method creates the singleton instance as soon as the class is loaded and thread-safe.

```java
public class Singleton {
    // Instance is created at the time of class loading
    private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();

    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation
    private Singleton() {}

    // Public method to get the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Lazy Initialization** (Not thread-safe)
In this method, the instance is created only when it is needed. However, it's not thread-safe by default.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Private constructor
    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Thread-Safe Singleton (Using Synchronization)**
To make the above implementation thread-safe, we can synchronize the `getInstance()` method.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 4. **Double-Checked Locking Singleton**
This method reduces the overhead of synchronization by checking the instance twice â€” once without synchronization and then again with synchronization.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### 5. **Bill Pugh Singleton Design (Initialization-on-demand holder idiom)**
This is the most efficient way and is thread-safe. It takes advantage of the Java ClassLoader mechanism for lazy loading and thread-safety.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private Singleton() {}

    private static class SingletonHelper {
        // Singleton instance will be created when the class is loaded by the class loader
        private static final Singleton INSTANCE = new Singleton();
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        return SingletonHelper.INSTANCE;
    }
}
```

# Insurance Application

Hereâ€™s the functional requirements and design for an insurance application:

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**
   - Users can create an account by providing personal information.
   
2. **User Authentication**
   - Users can log in using their credentials.

3. **Profile Management**
   - Users can view and update their personal information.

4. **Policy Browsing**
   - Users can view a list of available insurance policies.

5. **Policy Application**
   - Users can apply for a selected insurance policy by filling out an application form.

6. **Payment Processing**
   - Users can make premium payments using various methods.

7. **View Policy Details**
   - Users can view detailed information about their existing insurance policies.

8. **Policy Renewal**
   - Users can renew their existing policies through the application.

9. **Policy Cancellation**
   - Users can initiate the cancellation of an insurance policy.

10. **Payment History**
    - Users can view their payment history.

11. **Claims Submission**
    - Users can file a claim related to a specific insurance policy by filling out a claim form.

12. **Claim Status Tracking**
    - Users can track the status of their submitted claims.

13. **Claim History**
    - Users can view their past claims, including details and outcomes.

14. **Notifications**
    - Users receive notifications for important updates (policy renewals, claim status).

## Designing class diagram

### 1. **Understand the Purpose of the Class Diagram**
   - Determine what you need the diagram to represent. Are you modeling a specific part of a system, or the entire system? Clarify the scope of your design.

### 2. **Identify Key Classes**
   - Identify the main objects or entities that need to be represented in the system. These might include real-world objects or concepts that the software needs to model.

   - Example: In Insurance Application, classes could include `User`, `Policy`, `Application`, `Payment`, `PaymentHistory`, `Claim`, `Notification`, etc.

### 3. **Define Attributes**
   - Identify the properties or attributes that each class should have. These represent the data that each object will hold.
   - Example:
      - User class - `userID`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `phone number`, `address`, `dateOfBirth`.
      - Policy class - `policyID`, `policyName`, `description`, `coverageAmount`, `premiumAmount`, `policyType`, `startDate`, `endDate`.
      - Application class - `applicationID`, `applicationType`, `applicationDate`, `applicationStatus`.
      - Payment class - `paymentID`, `paymentAmount`, `paymentDate`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentStatus`.
      - PaymentHistory class - `paymentHistoryID`, `paymentDate`, `paymentAmount`, `paymentMethod`.
      - Claim class -  `claimID`, `claimDate`, `claimAmount`, `claimStatus`, `claimDetails`.
      - Notificatin class - `notificationID`, `notificationType`, `message`, `dateSent`.

### 4. **Define Methods**
   - Determine the behavior of each class by identifying the methods or functions each class will have. These operations define the actions that can be performed on instances of the class.

   - Example:
      - User class - `register()`, `logIn()`, `updateProfile()`, `receiveNotification()`.
      - Policy class - `viewDetails()`, `applyForPolicy()`, `renewPolicy()`, `cancelPolicy()`.
      - Application class - `submitApplication()`, `trackApplicationStatus()`.
      - Payment class - `makePayment()`, `viewPaymentHistory()`.
      - Claim class - `submitClaim()`, `trackClaimStatus()`, `viewClaimHistory()`.

### 5. **Define Relationships Between Classes**
   - Identify how the classes interact with each other. This includes:
     - **Associations**: Classes are related to one another in some way.
     - **Inheritance**: One class inherits properties and behaviors from another.
     - **Aggregation/Composition**: One class is made up of other classes.
     - **Dependency**: One class depends on another for its functionality.
   
   - Example: A `Library` class might have a one-to-many relationship with a `Book` class (one library has many books).

### 6. **Refine the Design**
   - Refine your class diagram by reviewing the relationships, attributes, and methods to ensure they correctly represent the system's design. Make sure you have not overlooked any important relationships or data points.
   - Apply principles like **normalization**, **encapsulation**, **modularity**, and **cohesion** to ensure your diagram is effective and maintainable.

### 7. **Draw the Class Diagram**
   - Now, start creating the actual diagram using UML (Unified Modeling Language) notation:
     - **Class boxes**: Represent each class with a rectangle divided into three sections (name, attributes, and methods).
     - **Lines for relationships**: Draw lines to represent associations, inheritance, and other relationships.
     - **Arrows for directionality**: Use arrows to indicate the direction of associations or dependencies.
     - **Multiplicity**: Indicate the number of instances related (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) next to association lines.
